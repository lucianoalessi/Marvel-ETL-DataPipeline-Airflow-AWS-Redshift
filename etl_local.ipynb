    "In this block, several transformations are performed on the data from the `characters` and `comics` tables obtained from the `bronze` layer of the data lake. These transformations include data loading, DataFrame merging, removal of duplicate and null values, optimization of data types for performance improvement, date manipulation, and renaming of columns for clarity. Finally, the transformed data is stored in the `silver` layer in Parquet format.\n",

    "   - Filter the relevant columns for analysis.\n",
    "   - Replace empty strings with null values (`NaN`) and impute default values for null fields.\n",
    "   - Optimize numerical column types to smaller types (`int16`) to reduce memory usage, and convert some text columns to `categories`.\n",
    "   - Format the `modified` date column to `datetime`, handling invalid values and setting a default date for null values.\n",
